# Amapiano AI - Comprehensive App Overview

## What is Amapiano AI?

Amapiano AI is the world's first artificial intelligence platform specifically designed for creating, analyzing, and exploring amapiano music. It combines cutting-edge AI technology with deep cultural understanding to provide an authentic, comprehensive tool for amapiano music production and education.

## The App in Detail

### Core Functionality

#### 1. AI Music Generation
**What it does**: Creates complete amapiano tracks from simple text descriptions
**How it works**: 
- Users input text prompts like "A soulful private school amapiano track with jazzy piano chords and deep log drums"
- AI analyzes the prompt and generates a full 3-minute track
- Users can customize BPM (100-140), key signature, mood, and duration
- System outputs both the complete track and individual stems (drums, bass, piano, other)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Transformer-based neural networks trained on 10,000+ amapiano tracks
- Separate models for Classic Amapiano and Private School Amapiano
- Real-time generation (under 60 seconds for full track)
- High-quality audio output (44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum)

#### 2. Audio Analysis Engine
**What it does**: Analyzes existing amapiano tracks to extract musical elements
**How it works**:
- Users provide YouTube URLs, upload files, or paste audio links
- AI separates the track into individual stems (drums, bass, piano, vocals, other)
- System identifies chord progressions, drum patterns, and basslines
- Provides confidence scores and time-stamped analysis

**Technical Implementation**:
- Deep learning source separation models
- Music information retrieval algorithms
- Pattern recognition with 95%+ accuracy
